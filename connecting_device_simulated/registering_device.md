# Unit 1: Registering Devices on EnOS Console

Before connecting devices to EnOS IoT hub, you need to register the devices on the EnOS Console, which includes defining the device model, creating a product, registering the devices, and creating an asset tree for the devices.

This tutorial takes a battery device as an example, focusing on how to register a smart device that connects directly to the EnOS Cloud.

## Step 1: Defining a Model

A model is the abstraction of the features of an object that is connected to IoT hub. The device model defines the features of a device, including attributes, measuring points, services, and events. For more information about models, see [Thing Model](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/model/model_overview).

This step assumes that there is no device model to be reused on EnOS. Take the following steps to create a model named **battery** and define the needed features.

1. In the EnOS Console, click **Model** from the left navigation panel.

2. Click **New Model**, and provide the following settings in the **New Model** window:

   - **Identifier**: battery
   - **Model Name**: battery
   - **Category**: NA
   - **Create From**: No
   - **Source Model**: No
   - **Description**: Model for battery

3. Click **OK** to save the basic information of the model.

4. From the list of created model, click **Edit**, and then click the **Feature Definition** tab of the **Model Details** screen.

5. Click **Add** and create the following features in the **Add Feature** window:

   .. csv-table::
      :widths: auto

      "Feature Type", "Name", "Identifier", "Data Type", "Description"
      "Attribute", "brand", "brand", "String", "Brand information of the device"
      "Measuring Point", "temperature", "temperature", "Double", "Point to ingest the device temperature data"
      "Service", "start_charging", "start_charging", "--", "Service that controls the charging status of the device"

See the following screen capture of the created features of the model:

For details about device model settings, see [Creating a Model](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/model/creating_model).

## Step 2: Creating a Product

A product is a collection of devices with the same features. On the basis of the device model, a product further defines the communication specifications for the device.

In this step, create a product called **Battery_Product**. Assume that a device of this product model sends data in JSON format and that the data transmission is not encrypted using CA certificate.

1. In the EnOS Console, select **Device Management > Product**.

2. Click **New Product**, and provide the following settings in the **New Product** window:

   - **Product Name**: Battery_Product
   - **Asset Type**: Device
   - **Device Model**: battery
   - **Data Type**: JSON
   - **Certificate-based bi-directional authentication**: Disabled
   - **Description**: Computer Battery

3. Click **OK** to save the configuration.

For details about the configuration of a product, see [Creating a Product](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/cloud/creating_product).

## Step 3: Registering a Device

A device is the instance of a product. A device is created from a product so that it inherits not only the basic features of the model, but also the communication features of the product (the device key-secret pair and
device certificate used for secure communication).

In this step, create a device named **battery1**, which belongs to the **Battery_Product** created in the previous step.

1. In the EnOS Console, select **Device Management > Device**.

2. Click **New Device**, and provide the following settings in the **New Device** window:

   - **Product**: Battery_Product
   - **Device Name**: battery1
   - **Timezone/City**: UTC+08:00
   - **Use DST**: No
   - **Device Key**: Optional (it can be generated automatically by the system)
   - **brand**: Enter the brand information of the battery (an attribute defined for the model)

3. Click **Confirm** to save the configuration.

For details about device settings, see [Creating a Device](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/cloud/creating_device).

After you complete the device registration, find the registered device from the device list, and click the **View** icon in the **Operations** column to open the **Device Details** page. You can get the device triple properties: `Product Key`, `Device Key`, and `Device Secret`, which will be used in connecting the device to EnOS IoT hub.
