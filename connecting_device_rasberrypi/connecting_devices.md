# Unit 4: Developing Python Program to Enable RPi to Connect

After the device modeling and alert configuration are completed on EnOS Consle, you can program with the EnOS Device SDK for MQTT for Python to connect the RPi into EnOS.

For detailed information about the EnOS Device SDK for MQTT for Python, refer to the readme file on [GitHub](https://github.com/EnvisionIot/enos-mqtt-sdk-python).

## Step 1: Setting Up Development Environment

EnOS Device SDK for MQTT for Python requires Python 2.7.12 or higher version. Take the following steps to set up the development environment on RPi:

1. Run the following commands to install the needed SDKs:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
   sudo apt-get install python-opencv
   ```

2. Run `pip install enos-mqtt-sdk-python` in the Terminal to install the EnOS Device SDK.

## Step 2: Programming for Connection

After the EnOS Device SDK for MQTT for Python is installed, take the following steps to connect the RPi device into EnOS Cloud (you can also refer to the code sample in the SDK readme file):

1. Develop a python program offline for connecting the RPi to EnOS. The program needs to include the following parts:

   - The directory that contains the python program and log files in the RPi system.
   - The host and port of the EnOS service. Contact your EnOS project manager for details if needed.
   - The keys and secrets of the product and devices, which are generated when registering the devices on EnOS Console.

2. Make sure the keys and secrets of the product, device, and sub-device are correct, as well as asset ID.

3. Copy the python program to the USB flash disk and plug in it on RPi. Then copy the program to a folder you want.

The following sample program is for your reference:

.. note:: In this sample, the LED light control signal and status signal are real physical signals, and the humidity and temperature data is simulated.

## Step 3: Running the Program for Connection

Take the following steps to run the program:

1. In the Terminal, run the python program. See the following example:

   .. image:: media/run_program.png

2. Check the running status of the program. The measure point data will start to be uploaded to the EnOS Cloud.
