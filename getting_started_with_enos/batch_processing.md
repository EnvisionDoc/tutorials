#  Unit 5: Integrating Offline data and Batch Processing

EnOS Data Analytics Offering provides end-to-end toolsets to help you load your data from various data sources into a unified analytical data store in EnOS, process the data through orchestrating work flows, and analyze the data quickly and interactively. 

The Data Analytics Offering mainly provides the following services.

## Data Integration

Use the Data Integration service to integrate your data from external systems to EnOS. EnOS supports to EnOS supports to connect to various types of data sources. For more information, see [Data Connections](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/data_source/datasource_overview). Based on your needs, you can perform a full-load data synchronization with a manual workflow or incremental data synchronizations with a periodical workflow that runs based on your scheduled frequency. For more information, see [Data Integration](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/data_integration/di_overview).

## Data IDE

Perform data development based on the GUI-based Data IDE. You can use the programs in the common library for most frequently used data development tasks such as converting columns to rows, or you can write your own shell script to be run by your workflows. For more information, see [Data IDE](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/data_ide/dataide_overview).

## Data Explorer

Data Explorer helps you process data in a web notebook based interactive experience without having to use complex command lines. Use the Data Explorer Service to quickly explorer your data for validation or quick proof of concepts.  [Data Explorer](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/data_explorer/dataexplorer_overview)
