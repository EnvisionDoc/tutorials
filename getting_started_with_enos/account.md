# Unit 1: Registering for an Account

To get started with EnOS, you will first need an account to access EnOS Console. You can register for an individual account or an enterprise account based on your business needs.

On the login page of EnOS Console, click **Sign Up Now** to open the account registration page.

## Individual Account

Individual account is mainly for individual developers or for test or demo purposes.

Take the following steps to request for an individual account.

1. Select **Individual** on the account registration page. 
2. Enter your user name and password, and select a verification method (by email or by phone). 
3. Enter the received verification code and submit the account registration information.

After your account request is approved, you can log in EnOS Console to start your journey with EnOS.

## Enterprise Account

Enterprise account is an independent tenant who has exclusive space and resources that are segregated from other tenants on the cloud. The space for the tenant is called organization unit (OU) in EnOS.

Take the following steps to apply for an enterprise account:

1. Select **Enterprise** on the account registration page.
2. Enter the name of your enterprise or organization.
3. Enter the information of the enterprise owner.  
4. Enter the received verification code and submit the account registration information.

After the enterprise account is created, the OU owner can log in EnOS Console to complete further configuration for the OU. The OU owner can create additional accounts and assign proper rights for relevant roles in the enterprise, such as IoT engineers, business analysts, and application developers.

## User Account and Permissions

To secure your assets and data, EnOS enforces access control
- at the service level, so that a user would need to request proper access from the OU administrator to be able to read, write, or control objects in a service.
- at the asset level, so that a user can only access the assets that are authorized to the user.

For information about how to manage the OU, users, and permissions, see [Identity and Access Management](/docs/iam/en/latest/iam_overview).
